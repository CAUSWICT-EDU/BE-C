Welcome to guess the number game! A game where you, the player, guess the 3 digit number randomly created by the computer!

You have 10 attempts to guess a randomly generated number. After each guess, the computer will provide feedback. 
"Correct position" means you've guessed a number and its position correctly. 
"Correct number" means the number you've guessed is in the random number but in the wrong position. 

When you run out of tries, the game will end and will display the correct number. 

Be sure to enter only 3 digits, with no spaces between the numbers! Other inputs will result in an error!

The language of the game is conducted in English, and English only. 

Good luck!
